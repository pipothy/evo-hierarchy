# evo-hierarchy
This is a repository for code to test some evolutionary algorithms with hierarchical separation in parameter learning

Each file is a different genetic algorithm, programmed in matlab. The only exception to this is stblrnd (which is used to pull 
random values from the levy distribution).

Each file takes an input parameter of the number of iterations. Other parameters are manually set in the file at the top.
